# üîÑ GitHub Taskfile Templates

This directory contains reusable Taskfile templates for GitHub operations, including managing submodules, handling releases, merging pull requests, and more.

## üìã Prerequisites

- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (required for some GitHub CLI extensions)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed (for JSON processing)
- Task installed (`brew install go-task/tap/go-task`)

## üéØ Available Tasks

### check-gh-cli

Validates that GitHub CLI is installed on your system.

```bash
task check-gh-cli
```

### add-git-submodules

Adds multiple GitHub repositories as submodules based on a naming pattern.

```bash
task add-git-submodules ORG=myorg REGEXP="^prefix-.*" TARGET_DIR=modules
```

Required variables:

- `ORG`: GitHub organization name
- `REGEXP`: Pattern to match repository names
- `TARGET_DIR`: Directory where submodules will be added

### remove-git-submodules

Removes one or more git submodules and cleans up related files.

```bash
task remove-git-submodules SUBMODULE_PATH=path/to/submodule
```

Required variables:

- `SUBMODULE_PATH`: Path to the submodule to remove

### create-release

Creates a GitHub release using a changelog file.

```bash
task create-release NEXT_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Required variables:

- `NEXT_VERSION`: Version number for the release

### create-release-with-notes

Creates a GitHub release with automatically generated release notes.

```bash
task create-release-with-notes NEXT_VERSION=1.0.0
```

Required variables:

- `NEXT_VERSION`: Version number for the release

### merge-pull-requests

Squash and merges all eligible pull requests, closing those with conflicts or failing checks.

```bash
task merge-pull-requests
```

### diff-changes

Shows git diff while excluding specified patterns.

```bash
task diff-changes BASE_BRANCH=main EXCLUDES="test,.github,.terraform*,*.md"
```

Required variables:

- `BASE_BRANCH`: Branch to compare against
- `EXCLUDES`: Comma-separated list of patterns to exclude

## üìù Example Usage

1. **Adding multiple submodules matching a pattern:**

```bash
task add-git-submodules ORG=mycompany REGEXP="^api-.*" TARGET_DIR=apis
```

2. **Creating a release with auto-generated notes:**

```bash
task create-release-with-notes NEXT_VERSION=1.2.0
```

3. **Removing a submodule:**

```bash
task remove-git-submodules SUBMODULE_PATH=modules/api-service
```

4. **Viewing changes excluding certain patterns:**

```bash
task diff-changes BASE_BRANCH=main EXCLUDES="test,docs/*,*.md"
```

## üîß Extending Tasks

You can extend these tasks in your own Taskfile by importing this template and overriding or adding new tasks:

```yaml
version: "3"

includes:
  gh:
    taskfile: ./github.yml
    optional: true

tasks:
  # Override or extend existing tasks
  create-release:
    deps: [gh:create-release]
    cmds:
      - echo "Additional steps after release creation..."

  # Add new tasks that use the base tasks
  release-and-merge:
    cmds:
      - task: gh:create-release-with-notes
        vars:
          NEXT_VERSION: 1.0.0
      - task: gh:merge-pull-requests
```

## üîç Important Notes

- The GitHub CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth login`) before using these tasks
- Some tasks require the `gh-submodule-add` extension, which will be automatically installed
- All tasks have appropriate error handling and validation
- Use `DEBUG=true` with tasks to enable additional debugging output
- The `merge-pull-requests` task will only merge PRs that have passing checks and no conflicts
- Release tasks expect a proper changelog structure in the repository
