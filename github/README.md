- `EXCLUDES`: Comma-separated list of patterns to exclude

## 📝 Example Usage

1. **Adding multiple submodules matching a pattern:**

```bash
task add-git-submodules ORG=mycompany REGEXP="^api-.*" TARGET_DIR=apis
```

2. **Creating a release with auto-generated notes:**

```bash
task create-release-with-notes NEXT_VERSION=1.2.0
```

3. **Removing a submodule:**

```bash
task remove-git-submodules SUBMODULE_PATH=modules/api-service
```

4. **Viewing changes excluding certain patterns:**

```bash
task diff-changes BASE_BRANCH=main EXCLUDES="test,docs/*,*.md"
```

## 🔧 Extending Tasks

You can extend these tasks in your own Taskfile by importing this template and overriding or adding new tasks:

```yaml
version: "3"

includes:
  gh:
    taskfile: ./github.yml
    optional: true

tasks:
  # Override or extend existing tasks
  create-release:
    deps: [gh:create-release]
    cmds:
      - echo "Additional steps after release creation..."

  # Add new tasks that use the base tasks
  release-and-merge:
    cmds:
      - task: gh:create-release-with-notes
        vars:
          NEXT_VERSION: 1.0.0
      - task: gh:merge-pull-requests
```

## 🔍 Important Notes

- The GitHub CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth login`) before using these tasks
- Some tasks require the `gh-submodule-add` extension, which will be automatically installed
- All tasks have appropriate error handling and validation
- Use `DEBUG=true` with tasks to enable additional debugging output
- The `merge-pull-requests` task will only merge PRs that have passing checks and no conflicts
- Release tasks expect a proper changelog structure in the repository
